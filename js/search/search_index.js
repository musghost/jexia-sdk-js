contributing","body":"\n                   \n\nContribution Guide\nFirst please read and abide by the Code of Conduct.\nEnvironment\nEverything you need is a stable version of Node.JS (v8+).\nCoding Style Guidelines\nThe source code is written in TypeScript using strict compilation mode and all the ES2017 features. We are following the TSLint and Editorconfig rules listed at their config files. We strongly recommend to use a code editor with good support for these tools (we recommend VSCode), so that it is easy to integrate new code into our code base.\nFirst Run\nAfter cloning the project and installing the dependencies with npm install you should be able start coding.\nYou can double check if the local environment is fully working by running the tests with npm test and building the project with npm run build.\nMain Development Commands\nExecute unit tests and check coverage:\n\nnpm test\n\nExecute unit tests in watch mode for TDD purposes:\n\nnpm run tdd\n\nLint Typescript code:\n\nnpm run lint\n\nCommit convention helper (see related topic below):\n\nnpm run commit\n\nGenerate API reference documentation locally:\n\nnpm run docs\n\nBuild the project locally:\n\nnpm run build\n\nCommit Message Format\nThis repository follows a strict Commit Message Conventions, which leads to more readable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history. Also, we use the git commit messages to generate the change log, calculate the new version number and automatically publish new versions to NPM. For these purposes, we are using Semantic Release. We have a helper script npm run commit that provides a command line based wizard for easy commit message formatting.\nEach commit message consists of a header, a body and a footer. The header has a special format that includes a type, a scope and a subject:\n(): \n\n\n\nOnly the first line is mandatory, and any line of the commit message cannot be longer than 100 characters! A linter will check your commit message in a git hook for each commit and guide you to fix any error. Please take a look at the AngularJS Commit Message Conventions for detailed information about this convention.\nSubmitting a Pull Request (PR)\nBefore you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:\n\nSearch our repository for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.\nFork the project on Github\nMake your changes in a new git branch:\n  git checkout -b my-fix-branch master\nCreate your patch, following code style guidelines, and including appropriate test cases.\n\nRun the full test suite and ensure that all tests pass.\nCommit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows our commit message format:\n   npm run commit\nPush your branch to your GitHub fork:\n  git push origin my-fix-branch\nIn GitHub, send a pull request to jexia-sdk-js:master.\n\nCheck if our Continuous Integration checks passed against your PR and make the necessary fixes if something breaks.\nIf we suggest changes then:\n\nPlease apply the required updates.\nRe-run the test suites to ensure tests are still passing.\nRe-run performance tests to make sure your changes didn't hurt performance.\nRebase your branch and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request):\ngit rebase master -i\ngit push -f\n\n\n\nThat's it!

Quick Start Guide","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Start Guide for the Javascript SDK\nThe SDK currently exposes the following features:\n\non-demand access to data stored in DataSets (creating, reading, updating, deleting records)\nAuthentication and authorization is handled automatically by the SDK, the user only needs to provide credentials once at SDK initialization.\n\nThe SDK is currently focused on consuming data. Managing the data schema (creating Datasets, adding columns to Datasets, etc.) is out of scope for now. The data schema management is done through our web application at app.jexia.com.\nOn-demand data access\nThe user can execute the following operations on records:\n\ncreate\nread\nupdate\ndelete\n\nExecuting an operation on a set of records is done through a Query. Depending on their type, Queries give the user access to some (or all) of the following options:\n\nfiltering (only records satisfying a certain condition will be retrieved/affected)\nsorting (the records will be sorted by a rule and direction before the action is executed)\nlimiting/offsetting (only a certain number of records, starting from a certain position in the Dataset will be affected)\nselecting the fields to be retrieved (when the user does not want the entire record to be retrieved, only certain columns)\nrelations (records from related datasets, as instructed, will also be affected by the request)\n\nAll these features are handled server-side. Right now there is no client-side functionality implemented for filtering, sorting, etc. \nCode samples\nPlease keep in mind that this quick start guide uses Javascript 2017 syntax.\nThe examples are made with a simple data schema in mind: think a basic social media platform where users can write posts and/or comments to posts. A post can be related to any number of comments, while each post and each comment has a user as author.\nImporting the SDK into your JS project\nimport { jexiaClient } from \"Anemo SDK location\";Initialization and Authentication\nThe jexiaClient() function will return an instance of the Client class. You can provide a custom fetch standard compliant function as a parameter, as default we are using are using node-fetch package at NodeJS, and the native fetch implementation on at the browser.\nimport { jexiaClient } from \"Anemo SDK location\";\n\nlet initializedClientPromise = jexiaClient().init({projectID: \"your Jexia App URL\", key: \"username\", secret: \"password\"});\ninitializedClientPromise.then( (initializedClient) => {\n  // you have been succesfully logged in!\n}).catch( (error) => {\n  // uh-oh, there was a problem logging in, check the error.message for more info\n});The Module system\nThe Jexia SDK is built as a set of modules (or plugins) structured around a core entity (the Client class used above).\nIn order to use a module you need to:\n\ninitialize it\npass it to the Client when calling the .init() method\n\nProbably the most useful module is the Data Operation Module (DataOperationsModule class). The example below will show how to initialize the SDK using this module. Follow the dataModule variable to see how this mechanism works.\nThe modules await the client initialization before make any operation that depends on it, so you don't need to manually await the client initialization promise.\nimport { jexiaClient, dataOperations } from \"Anemo SDK Location\";\n\nlet dataModule = dataOperations();\n\njexiaClient().init({projectID: \"your Jexia App URL\", key: \"username\", secret: \"password\"}, dataModule);\n\ndataModule.dataset(\"posts\")\n  .select()\n  .then( (data) => {\n    // you have been succesfully logged in!\n    // you can start using the dataModule variable to operate on records here\n  }).catch( (error) => {\n    // uh-oh, there was a problem logging in, check the error.message for more info\n  });Dataset objects and Query objects\nUsing an initialized DataOperationsModule object, you can instantiate Dataset objects like so:\n[..]\nlet postsDataset = dataModule.dataset(\"posts\");\n[..]Using a Datase object, you can instantiate a Query object, depending on the type of query you want to execute\n[..]\nlet selectQuery = postsDataset.select();\nlet insertQuery = postsDataset.insert( [ post1, post2 ] );\nlet updateQuery = postsDataset.update( [ title: \"Updated title\" ] );\nlet deleteQuery = postsDataset.delete();\n[..]Any Query can be executed by calling .execute() on it. This results in a Promise resolving to a set of records, regardless of the type of Query executed. For select queries, the records returned are the records that the user wants to retrieve. For the other queries, the records returned are the actual records that have been operated on (modified, added or deleted).\nEach different Query type has different support for the query options (filtering, sorting, etc.). E.g. you cannot apply filtering to insert queries, as the method isn't defined on the InsertQuery object.\nOur first query: selecting all records in a dataset\nUsing all the temporary variables in this example is for demonstration purposes, mostly to point out the different objects and functionality involved when working with records.\n[..]\njexiaClient(fetch).init({projectID: \"your Jexia App URL\", key: \"username\", secret: \"password\"}, dataModule);\n\nlet postsDataset = dataModule.dataset(\"posts\");\nlet unexecutedQuery = postsDataset.select();\nlet executedQueryPromise = unexecutedQuery.execute();\n\nexecutedQueryPromise.then( (records) => {\n  // you can start iterating through the posts here\n}).catch( (error) => {\n  // there was a problem retrieving the records\n});\n[..]If you watch closely, the API is chainable, so you can rewrite the query in a much less verbose way:\n[..]\njexiaClient(fetch).init({projectID: \"your Jexia App URL\", key: \"username\", secret: \"password\"}, dataModule);\n\ndataModule.dataset(\"posts\")\n  .select()\n  .execute()\n  .then( (records) => {\n    // you can start iterating through the posts here\n  }).catch( (error) => {\n    // there was a problem retrieving the records\n  });\n[..]But at the very least, defining dataset variables could come in handy when executing multiple different queries on the same dataset.\nSorting records\nTo activate sorting, you need to call .sortAsc or .sortDesc on a Query object and pass as string the name of the field you want to sort by.\n[..]\nposts.select().sortAsc(\"id\").execute().then( (records) => {\n  // operate on your sorted records here\n});\n[..]Limit and offset\nYou can use .limit and .offset on a Query object for these options. They can be used separately or together. Only setting the limit (to a value X) will make the query operate on the first X records. Only setting the offset will make the query operate on the last Y records, starting from the offset value. \n[..]\nposts.select().limit(2).offset(5).execute().then( (records) => {\n  // records will be an array of 2 records, starting from position 5 in the Dataset\n});\n[..]Only retrieving certain fields\nYou can use the .fields method to define what fields you want to retrieve.\n[..]\nposts.select().fields(\"id\", \"title\").execute().then( (records) => {\n  // the individual record objects will only have the two properties defined above\n});\n[..]Filtering records\nYou can use the filtering feature to select what records a certain query will operate on.\nIn order to define a filter, you need to use the appropriate filtering objects. They can be created using the exposed methods field and combineCriteria. combineCriteria is something very specific that provides another way to create nested logical conditions. You're probably not going to use that much, but it's useful to know that it exists.\nimport { field } from \"Anemo SDK location\";\n\nlet simpleCriterion = field(\"username\").isEqualTo(\"Tom\");\nlet combinedCriteria = simpleCriterion.or(field(\"username\").isEqualTo(\"Dick\"));In order to use these conditions, they need to be added to a query using the .where method\n[..]\nposts.select().where(field(\"username\").isEqualTo(\"Harry\"));\n[..]The .where method also accepts a lazy callback, that receives the field method received as an argument:\n[..]\nposts.select().where(field => field(\"username\").isEqualTo(\"Harry\"));\n[..]Multiple .where calls can be chained, but only the last call will be taken into account. If a complex condition needs to be set for filtering, it has to be created in one go (in-line or not) and passed as an argument to the .where method.\nFiltering conditions can be nested at any level.\n[..]\nlet flatFilter = field(\"first_name\").isEqualTo(\"Tom\")\n                 .or( field(\"first_name\").isEqualTo(\"Dick\"))\n                 .or( field(\"first_name\").isEqualTo(\"Harry\"));\n\nlet nestedFilter = field(\"first_name\").isEqualTo(\"Tom\")\n                   .or( field(\"first_name\").isEqualTo(\"Dick\")\n                        .and( field(\"middle_name\").isEqualTo(\"Harry\")));\n\nlet anotherNestedFilter = field(\"first_name\").isEqualTo(\"Tom\")\n                   .or( field(\"first_name\").isEqualTo(\"Dick\")\n                        .and( field(\"middle_name\").isEqualTo(\"Harry\")\n                              .or( field(\"middle_name\").isEqualTo(\"Larry\"))));\n[..]Filtering operator list and examples\nYou can find a complete list of the operators supported for filtering in the API reference document.\nDefining relations\nRelations can be added to a query in order to have the query apply not only to the main dataset the query is created from, but also to related records from other datasets.\nRetrieving relations:\n[..]\nlet posts = dataModule.dataset(\"posts\");\nlet comments = dataModule.dataset(\"comments\");\nposts.select().relation(comments).execute().then( (records) => {\n  // objects in the records array will now contain a property called \"comments\"\n  // which will be an array holding the comments related to a particular post.\n});\n[..]Inserting records\n[..]\nlet posts = dataModule.dataset(\"posts\");\nposts.insert([ {title: \"New Post\", content:\"content here\"}, \n               {title: \"Another Post\", content:\"some more content\"} \n]).execute().then( (records) => {\n  // you will be able to access the newly inserted records here\n  // complete with their generated IDs\n}).catch( (error) => {\n  // you can see the error info here, if something goes wrong\n});\n[..]Updating records\nThe update method is used to modify records, it always has to be used with the where method and a filter criteria.\n[..]\nlet posts = dataModule.dataset(\"posts\");\nconst filter = field(\"id\").isInArray([1, 2]);\nposts.update({\n  title: \"Changing title\",\n}).where(filter).execute().then(() => {\n  // the elements that fill the criteria now have been changed\n}).catch( (error) => {\n  // you can see the error info here, if something goes wrong\n});Deleting records\n[..]\nlet posts = dataModule.dataset(\"posts\");\nposts.delete().where(field(\"title\").isLike(\"test\")).execute().then( (records) => {\n  // you will be able to access the deleted records here\n  // they won't be stored in the DB anymore, but maybe you\n  // want to display a visual confirmation of what got deleted\n}).catch( (error) => {\n  // you can see the error info here, if something goes wrong\n});\n[..]Logging off and cleanup\nThe Client class exposes a method called .terminate() which returns a Promise with the terminated Client instance. Use this to clear up resources used by the Client class and any modules you initialized along with it (you don't have to pass the modules along, the Client will terminate any modules you supplied on initialization.)\n[..]\nclient.terminate().then( (terminatedClient) => {\n  // everything has been cleared\n}).catch( (err)=>{\n  // something went wrong when cleaning up\n});\n[..]\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
